# DIT168 - GP13



## Introduction
Our project is about an autonomous car that is able to navigate the road during driving process, and communicate with other similar cars. Our goal is to develop the system that is completely independent from human operators, and can safely operate by itself.

## Organization
At this point of the project, the start, the repository is divided into five main folders: 

**1. Joystick:** Where the code for the Android app is stored. 

**2. src:** Where all the code will be available.
      **2.1. v2v-microservice:** On this folder you can find the microservice for communication across vehicles.
      **2.2. ps4:** This folder contains the ps4 microservice.
      **2.3. interceptor:** This folder contains the interceptor microservice, which is responsible to handle sensors and internal communications.
      **2.4. app:** On this folder the server microservide to run on the car for the android application can be found. 

**3. test:** This folder contains the TDD tests designed at the begining of the project and the dockerfile to build the test environment.

Outside this folders, there are documents that are important for the project's organization, existence, and maintenance, such as the code conventions used to build the project, the license, the contributing and the code of conduct.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Cloning
The project can be cloned using the URL provided in the github webpage of the project or you can clone the project by adding the following command on your terminal/bash:
```
git clone https://github.com/LaizFigueroa/DIT168.git
```
### Building
The Docker builds the project following the instructions in the dockerfile. A docker container is launched by running a docker image that will be loaded to the minature car. The docker image loaded is an executable package to run an applicationâ€“the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. To be able to build each microservice indenpendly you should access `src/<microservice>` and then:

- To build and send to the car using a .tar file
```
docker build -t dockerimg -f Dockerfile.manual.

docker save dockerimg > dit168.tar

cat dit168.tar | docker load
```

- To build and send to docker hub repository
```
docker build -t dockerimg -f Dockerfile.manual.

docker tag dockerimg DOCKER_HUB_REPOSITORY/dockerimg

docker push DOCKER_HUB_REPOSITORY/dockerimg
```

### Running tests
Automated tests: There will be automated tests for the `master` generated by Travis working hand-in-hand with the production code, available on: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LaizFigueroa/DIT168.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LaizFigueroa/DIT168).

Manual Tests: Upon pull request and integration testing, the features implemented will be tested in the simulation environment first, this is done using the docker image created using the `test/Dockerfile` and running manually the specific tool needed. You can use it by running the following command:
```
docker build -t test .
docker run test
```
### Docker Image
A docker image for the car is available on our [V2V Docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/laiz/v2v/), [App-Server Docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/laiz/app/) and [Interceptor Docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/laiz/interceptor/) or you can add the following command to your terminal:
```
docker pull laiz/v2v
docker pull laiz/interceptor
docker pull laiz/app
```
### Docker Compose
The file docker-compose.yml on the root directory contains all project's included microservices to run on the car. Only this file is necessary to be present on the car and the following command should be added to the terminal:
```
docker-compose up
```
