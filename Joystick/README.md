# DIT168 - GP13



## Introduction
Our project is about an autonomous car that is able to navigate the road during driving process, and communicate with other similar cars. Our goal is to develop the system that is completely independent from human operators, and can safely operate by itself.


## Organization
At this point of the project, the start, the repository is divided into five main folders: 

**1. Documentation:** Where all the documentation created along the project will be listed. 

**2. src:** Where all the code will be available. Probably this folder will have subfolders when the development phase is advancing.

**3. lib:** Libraries, images, anything used as a resource to the project will be available in this folder.

Outside this folders, there are documents that are important for the project's organization, existence, and maintenance, such as the code conventions used to build the project, the license, the contributing and the code of conduct.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Cloning
The project can be cloned using the URL provided in the github webpage of the project or you can clone the project by adding the following command on your terminal/bash:
```
git clone https://github.com/LaizFigueroa/DIT168.git
```
### Building
The Docker builds the project following the instructions in the dockerfile. A docker container is launched by running a docker image that will be loaded to the minature car. The docker image loaded is an executable package to run an applicationâ€“the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
```
docker build -t dockerimg -f dockerfile/Dockerfile.txt .

docker save dockerimg > dit168.tar

cat dit168.tar | docker load
```
### Running tests
Automated tests: There will be automated tests for the `master` generated by Travis working hand-in-hand with the production code, available on: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LaizFigueroa/DIT168.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LaizFigueroa/DIT168).

Manual Tests: Upon pull request and integration testing, the features implemented will be tested in the simulation environment first. Afterwards, at each milestone the current version of the development stage will be uploaded to the car as docker image. Hence, the manual testing can be automatically executed by testing the behaviour of the car.
```
docker run dockerimg
```
